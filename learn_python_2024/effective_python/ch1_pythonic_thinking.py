Know the Differences Between bytes and str 

- bytes contains sequences of 8-bit values, and str contains sequences of
  Unicode code points.

- str instances can be encoded to bytes, and bytes instances can be decoded to
  str.

- Python internally uses a Flexible String Representation to represent str,
  instead of UTF-8 or UTF-16, etc.

- When read and write files, use the 'b' flag to open files in binary
